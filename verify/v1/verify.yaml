      Verify service aims to provide information regarding phone numbers.
      
      Customers can define their own logic for verifying a number, by defining verify criteria templates. Customers can
      also define the response parameters that they would like to receive back.
      
      This dynamic configuration, provides customers with full control over tyntec's verify service.

      summary: Create criteria template
      description: |
        Create a Verify criteria template with desired verify rules and responses. Verify template creation is a crucial
        step in the Verify process. Without this step Verify process cannot be done.
        
        There are two types of Verify criteria templates:
        
         - Empty template or,
         - Customized template
        
        **Empty Verify criteria template**
        
        Empty template means that the default verify and response parameters will be used. This practically means:
        
         - Verify criteria
           - validNumberFormat: Verify that the phone number has a valid format
           - numberType: Verify that the phone number type is fixed or mobile

         - Response parameters
           - requestId: Unique request identifier
           - verified: Verify outcome
           - reason (only in case of unverified response)
           - reasonCode (only in case of unverified response)

        **Customized Verify criteria template**
                
        Customized templates are more complex to define but more powerful, since customers can define exactly how the
        Verify service should verify phone numbers and how the response should look like.
        
        The following verify parameter can be configured:
        
        | Criterion        | Variable Type | Allowed Operations | Allowed Values                                                                                                                  |
        | ---              | ---           | ---                | ---                                                                                                                             |
        | activeNumber     | boolean       | is                 | true/false                                                                                                                      |
        | numberType       | string        | is, is_in          | fixed or mobile. <p>In case of *is_in* operator multiple comma separated values can be provided</p>                             |
        | operatorCountry  | string        | is, is_in          | country in ISO Alpha-3 format e.g. DEU, GBR. <p>In case of *is_in* operator multiple comma separated values can be provided</p> |
        | disposableNumber | boolean       | is                 | true/false                                                                                                                      |
        | mccMnc           | string        | is, is_in          | MCC and MNC of the operator e.g. 23202. <p>In case of *is_in* operator multiple comma separated values can be provided</p>      |

        The following parameters can be configured for the response:
        
        - validNumberFormat
        - numberType
        - activeNumber
        - operatorName
        - OperatorCountry
        - mcc
        - mnc
        - disposableNumber

        In the Response message, parameters will respect the template configuration order.
        
        Moreover, following parameters will be always shown in the response
        
        - requestId
        - verified
        - reason (only in case of unverified response)
        - reasonCode (only in case of unverified response)
        
        However, customers can use those parameters in the response configuration just for manipulating 
        the order of the Response parameters.

        Modify an existing criteria template. Customers can update name, description, criteria and response by providing 
        the whole json structure.
        
        Criteria can be modified similarly with the criteria template creation.

      summary: Verify by criteria template
      description: |
        Verify a phone number based on a criteria.
        
        Each criteria has a defined verify and response parameters, set at the criteria creation api request. 
        Verify request is based on the defined criteria for providing feedback regarding the requested phone number. 
        
        Example of a successful Verify response is shown at the code section at the right side of this page.
        
        Unverified requests do not respect the defined parameter set in the response of the criteria, but they are using
        a default set of response parameters, aiming to explain to the customer the reason that the request was unverified.
        The unverified request response will always show the following four parameters:
        
        - requestId
        - verified
        - reason
        - reasonCode
        
        When a phone number is evaluated as unverified, the following reason codes and reasons explanation will be included in the response:
        
        | reasonCode | Criterion         | reason                                                                                                        |
