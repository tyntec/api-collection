      tyntecâ€™s IP restriction service allows you to:

      - Enable or disable IP whitelisting on your account
      - Add multiple IPs or even IP subnets to the whitelist

      **Important**

      Be extra careful while using this service, as it will have immediate effect and potentially block your ongoing traffic.

      The current IP used for calling tyntec's API cannot be excluded from whitelisted IPs. If you need to exclude this specific IP then the API call should be done from a different IP.
