    Delivery updates and inbound messages are sent out to you in a manner of events.

    They are sent to the callback URLs that you specified in a [tyntec application](/conversations/current.html#webhook-configuration).

    Inbound messages are sent to your system as soon as we receive them from the channel.

    Delivery updates are sent to your system when:

    - a message reaches a final state, or
    - a message reaches an intermediate state and you opted-in to receive this, or
    - a user decides to delete a message previously sent **to** you (only available on WhatsApp).

    We treat

    - delivered
    - seen / read
    - finally failed

    as final states for messages sent by you.

    All other states are treated as intermediate states.
