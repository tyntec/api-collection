  title: Common operations
  description: |
    In this section, you find an overview of operations common to all Conversations [channels](#channels).

    The Conversations API works as a wrapper for messaging on varied channels and aims to provide a common data model
    unified to the greatest possible extent.

    Here are some guidelines on general usage.
    For details about interaction on a particular channel, please refer to the channel-specific section.

    ### Sending messages

    All channels use the same endpoint and generic data model for requests to send messages. However, the components
    of messages beyond plain text are channel-specific. Some channels enforce special policies and restrictions,
    for example, the WhatsApp channel, and you need to watch that you comply with them in the context of your use case.

    <!-- NOTE Channels are expected to be used separately, not in cascades anymore (discontinued in the next version) -->

    For details on the channels, please refer to the channel-specific section.

    **Media and other non-text content**

    Some channels allow you to attach images, video, audio, stickers, buttons, or URLs.
    These kinds of content are channel-specific.

    **Bulk messaging**

    All channels provide the functionality of sending bulks of messages. A bulk of messages is always sent via one
    channel to a single recipient.

    Our system guarantees that the messages are sent to the recipient in the requested order.

    ### Receiving status updates

    The API allows you to automatically receive delivery notifications and status updates about messages that you
    sent to your channels.

    For this service, you will need to provide a URL (`messageStatusUrl`) at your webserver,
    e.g. `https://rest.customer.com/messagestatus/`. This URL must serve a webhook able to process POST HTTP requests,
    which the tyntec system will fire upon events in the system, in this case upon message status updates.

    You may also configure an opt-in filter on one or more `MessageStatus::*` event types in the Configuration, see
    [Webhook Configuration](#configurations) and [Webhook Events V2](#webhook-events-v2).
    The set of available event types slightly varies on each channel:

    | Channel | Accepted | Dispatched | Delivered | Seen | Channel failed | Deleted |
    | ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | WhatsApp | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
    | Viber | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ |
    | Telegram | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ |
    | WeChat | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ❌ |
    | SMS | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ✔ | ❌ |


    **Retries**

    The tyntec system will retry to post the request 2 more times in the case your
    webhook does not accept the request (final response codes other than 2xx).

    ### Receiving inbound messages

    The API allows you to automatically receive inbound messages sent to your channels by your customers.

    **Note:** For the SMS channel, you need to ask us to enable 2-way interaction,
    see [Channel specific prerequisites](#channels).

    For this service, you will need to provide a URL (`inboundMessageUrl`) at your webserver,
    e.g. `https://rest.customer.com/inboundmessages/`. This URL must serve a webhook able to process POST HTTP requests,
    which the tyntec system will fire upon the events of inbound messages.

    The events fired upon are of type `MoMessage`.

    **Retries**

    The tyntec system will retry to post the request in the case your webhook does not accept the request
    (final response codes other than 2xx), depending on the channel as follows:

    - *WhatsApp:* retries via the WhatsApp mechanism with exponential decrease in frequency of attempts that continues
      up to 14 days (attempts repeat less and less often)
    - *Viber:* TODO
    - *WeChat:* TODO
    - *Telegram:* TODO
    - *SMS:* retries every 10 seconds. Retries are paused for 10 minutes after every 100 consecutive unsuccessful
      delivery attempts. tyntec's system will keep trying for a maximum of 48 hours.

      After receiving an inbound message (_MoMessage_ event) with a media ID, this endpoint can be used to download
      the media file.
  - name: "Outbound media (Beta)"
    description: |
      As an alternative to the download of outbound media on message requests, we enable you to upload a media file
      and use it later when sending messages.

      After a successful upload, we generate an ID that is used as an alternative to the media URL.

      The uploaded media can be stored

      - as a static asset
      - only for a certain period
      - for one-time usage

      As this is in beta, we grant access to it only via an approved access request.
