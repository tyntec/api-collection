  title: Business Notification API Events
  version: '1'
  description: |
    The API allows you to automatically receive business notifications and updates about your account that you are using
    to send messages via channels.
    For this service, you will need to provide a URL (businessNotificationUrl) at your webserver, 
    e.g. https://rest.customer.com/businessnotification/. This URL must serve a webhook able to process POST HTTP requests, 
    which the tyntec system will fire upon events in the system, in this case upon updates of account status and entity
    regarding accounts (like templates, phone numbers, ...)
    
    **Example**
    
      ***Whatsapp Template status changed***
    
        - Submit your whatsapp template
        - Template is sent to Meta
        - Meta has changed status of your template (APPROVED, REJECTED, ...)
        - Receive info about change, together with reason and template info, on your webhook
    
    **Retries**

    The tyntec application will retry to post the request 2 more times in the case your
    webhook does not accept the request (final response codes other than 2xx).
