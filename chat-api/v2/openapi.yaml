  title: Chat API
  description: |
    The Chat API allows you to easily send messages to your customers via messaging services like WhatsApp 
    and still reach customers with classic SMS.

    In addition you can define a chain of channels which will be used for messaging attempts until one succeeds.

    Notifications and messages from your users are send by us to your system via HTTP ```POST``` method.
    
    **Channel specific pre-conditions**
    
    - *2-way SMS* : Please contact us to get the details for the 2-way SMS setup
    - *WhatsApp* : A WhatsApp Business Account is required in order to use this channel. Please [request access here](https://www.tyntec.com/form-whatsapp-request-your-access)

    **Adheared web-standards**

    One goal of the API is to follow best practices and standards around http based services.

    A building block of this is to follow the RFCs:

    - [RFC 5988 - Web Linking](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)
    - [RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)

    *RFC 5988* is implemented in a way that all API calls that return a list of resources, make use of the following Link headers

    - `first` : First page of the resource list pagination
    - `previous` : Predecessor page of the current page of the resource list pagination
    - `current` : Actual page of the resource list pagination
    - `next` : Successor page of the current of page of the resource list pagination
    - `last` : Last page of the resource list pagination



    In addition the following custom headers are provided for convenience

    - `x-total-pages` : Total number of pages of the list of requested sub-resources
    - `x-total-items` : Total number of items on the list of requested sub-resources
    - `x-page-size` : Maxium size of the page
    - `x-current-page` : Page number of the current page of the list of requested sub-resources

      In this section we guide you on how to send messages, get information about the status and the events happening
      during the delivery
  - name: "Receive messages"
    description: |
      In order to receive messages send by the user you need to configure first an public available endpoint.

      We will use HTTP ```POST``` method to send the user messages to your system as defined in MoMessage.

      Media send by the user can be downloaded by
        - either by following the link in the MoMedia object or
        - by using the received media id and query our system via _/media/{media-id}_ (see below)
  - name: "Notifications"
    description: |
      Notifications or DLRs are **send** to your system when

       - a message reaches a final state or
       - a message reaches an intermediate state and you opt-in to receive this
       - a user decides to delete a message previously send **to** you.
       - a user interacts with a group, such as joining or leaving the group

      We treat

        - delivered
        - seen / read
        - finally failed

      as final states for message send by you.

      All other states are treated as intermediate states.

      We will use HTTP ```POST``` method to send the notifications to your system.

      The notification message is the same as for the message status you can query MessageStatus.
  - name: "Applications"
    description: |
      The Chat API allows you to freely define which events should be sent via a callback URL to your webhook
      implementation.

      **Please note**:

       - By now, only a default application is supported. The extension to custom applications is planned for future releases
       - The API merges events pointing to the same callback URL into one set.
       - When an update of a callback URL is executed, the whole webhook definition must be restated.
  - name: "WA Account management"
    description: |
      The WA Account management grants you access to information about the WhatsApp accounts
      provisioned for you.

      At the moment it does not support requesting new WhatsApp accounts or editing existing ones.

      The WhatsApp account and it's subresources can *only* be managed by one of your CPaaS API Account.

      Read access to an account is available for all accounts that are associated with a phone number and thus eligible
      for sending messages.
  - name: "WA Template management"
    description: |
      The WA Template management enables you to interact with the templates defined for your WhatsApp account.

      We support creating or deleting templates and adding new localizations to an existing template.

      Due to restrictions by WhatsApp editing is not support yet.
  - name: "WA Phone Number insights"
    description: |
      The WA Phone Number insights allows you to get information about the status of a phone number.

      It also provides *read* access to the templates usable by the phone number.
