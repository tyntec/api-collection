  title: Chat API
  description: |
    The Chat API allows you to easily send messages to your customers via messaging services like WhatsApp 
    and still reach customers with classic SMS.

    In addition you can define a chain of channels which will be used for messaging attempts until one succeeds.

    Notifications and messages from your users are send by us to your system via HTTP ```POST``` method.
    
    **Channel specific pre-conditions**
    
    - *2-way SMS* : Please contact us to get the details for the 2-way SMS setup
    - *WhatsApp* : A WhatsApp Business Account is required in order to use this channel. Please [request access here](https://www.tyntec.com/form-whatsapp-request-your-access)

      In this section we guide you on how to send messages, get information about the status and the events happening
      during the delivery
  - name: "Receive messages"
    description: |
      In order to receive messages send by the user you need to configure first an public available endpoint.

      We will use HTTP ```POST``` method to send the user messages to your system as defined in MoMessage.

      Media send by the user can be downloaded by
        - either by following the link in the MoMedia object or
        - by using the received media id and query our system via _/media/{media-id}_ (see below)
  - name: "Notifications"
    description: |
      Notifications or DLRs are **send** to your system when

       - a message reaches a final state or
       - a message reaches an intermediate state and you opt-in to receive this
       - a user decides to delete a message previously send **to** you.
       - a user interacts with a group, such as joining or leaving the group

      We treat

        - delivered
        - seen / read
        - finally failed

      as final states for message send by you.

      All other states are treated as intermediate states.

      We will use HTTP ```POST``` method to send the notifications to your system.

      The notification message is the same as for the message status you can query MessageStatus.
  - name: "WA Group management"
    description: |
      The WA Group management enables you to interact with WhatsApps Group API.

      It allows you to list all created groups, create, update and delete a group and generate invite links.

      The general flow for groups is

      1. Create a new group
      2. Update the details, eg. the group icon
      3. Get the invite link to the group
      4. Send the invite link to the users that should join your group
      5. Start interacting with the users in the group

      **Note**

       - When sending messages to the group you need to use the group id as *to*. Not the normal phone number of your user.
       - There are no limits on the number of groups you can create.

      Events genereated from groups are send out as a notification of type _WhatsAppGroupEvent_
