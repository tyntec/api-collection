# Requesting new templates

These are examples on requesting new localizations for WhatsApp templates. 

You must have requested a template before.

In general a localization of a template can consist of the following three components:

#### Header

Could be either a text (up to 60 characters), an image or a document.

In case of a text up to one variable is supported. The variable is indicated by `{{1}}`.

#### Body

Simple text that can contain newlines, emojis, or urls and variables.

Variables are indicated by `{{n}}`, n sequential natural number without repetition.

A variable counts as 1 character for the length.

The body is limited to 1024 characters. **Note** this limit is applied also to the hydrated template, when a footer, header or buttons are used. A hydrated template is a template on which the variable replacements are applied.

The body **must** be present and **not** empty.

#### Footer

Text based footer up to 60 characters.
